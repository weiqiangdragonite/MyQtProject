/*
To organize the element below the image we used a Column positioner and
calculated the width and height based on the columnâ€™s childrenRect property. We
exposed two properties: text and the image source as also the clicked signal.
We also wanted that the text is as wide as the image and it should wrap. We
achieve the latter by using the Text elements wrapMode property.
